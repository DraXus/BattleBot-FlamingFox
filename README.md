BattleBot-FlamingFox
====================

FlamingFox is a naive robot mind based on a PIC16F628A microcontroller and a MSx84 control board.

The actual robot (named slightly differently) was built and developed in 2008-2009 for a course assignment by Luis Quesada (https://github.com/lquesada) and Manuel Mart√≠n (https://github.com/DraXus).

A video of the flawless victory of the robot can be seen in http://vimeo.com/3105046 .

In order to compile this bot mind, install sdcc and run

	$ make

The Makefile also contains sections for reading from a microcontroller, writing a microcontroller, and erasing a microcontroller using a SMT1 burner or similar.
